# ðŸš€ No-Code ML Builder

A Streamlit-based application to build, train, and evaluate machine learning models without writing code.  
Simply upload your dataset, preprocess it, choose algorithms, and get instant results.

## Features
- ðŸ“‚ Upload and manage CSV files
- ðŸ§¹ Preprocess data (null handling, encoding, etc.)
- ðŸ¤– Train ML models (classification & regression)
- ðŸŽ¯ Select the best model based on evaluation metrics
- ðŸ’¾ Save trained models for reuse

## How to use
1. Upload your dataset
2. Preprocess and clean data
3. Train multiple ML models
4. Select the best-performing model
5. Download and reuse saved models

## Run locally
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt  
streamlit run app.py

## Installation

To run this project, ensure you have Python installed on your machine. You can install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install streamlit pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn joblib
```

## Usage

1. **Run the Application**: Navigate to the project directory and run the following command:

   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

2. **File Management**: Use the "File Management" option in the sidebar to upload CSV files and manage them.

3. **Data Preprocessing**: Select the "Preprocessing Data" option to preprocess your uploaded CSV files. This includes viewing data, analyzing null values, and encoding categorical variables.

4. **Model Training**: Choose the "Model Training" option to train and evaluate various machine learning models on your preprocessed data.

5. **Model Selection**: Use the "Model Selection" option to select a specific model and determine whether the problem is a classification or regression problem.
